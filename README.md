## Objective
Food is a basic necessity for all. The modern world is a food paradise and people are willing to queue and try new and fun food. To ensure that their time and effort is worth it, people will usually check on food reviews to ensure the quality of food. 

For a demand side, people love taking photos of their “Instagram-worthy” food but are all the “Instagram-worthy” delicious and worth the hype?

This platform enables users to share their love for food and experience by publishing reviews and sharing with the community. By providing a review, they are paying it forward and help others in making good food choices. 


External user’s goal:
To share the love for food by publishing reviews and clock points to get exclusive discount codes.

Site owner’s goal:
Provide a platform for food reviews to share the love for food and expand the user base to attract restaurant owners to purchase advertising space eventually.

## UX
Information on the several restaurants such as website and address can be found on the home page. Users can be easily redirected to the several restaurants’ website if they would like to find out more. Search button is displayed prominently at the top menu bar to enable users to search for their preferred restaurants.

When clicking into the respective restaurant to find out more information, there is a “Back to Main Page” on the top banner to navigate back to the home page. The “New Review” button is also placed at the top of the page to allow users to add a review without looking through the other reviews. All the past reviews are ranked based on dates. The food item that was reviewed is also clearly displayed in the title of the reviews to enable easy viewing. Users can also do real-time updates of the reviews. Upon completion of the review, there is also a button to return to the main page. If users accidentally click the “Delete” button, there is an error message to prompt users that the action is irreversible and to confirm the action. Users can click “Cancel” to go back to the home page.

With the tagging of halal and type of cuisine, the website enables users to filter the results based on their preferences and dietary requirements.

Users are directed back the home page if there are no reviews for the restaurant which they are interested in.
