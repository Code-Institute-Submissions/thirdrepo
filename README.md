## Objective
Food is an essential need for all organisms, and we humans are no exception. It is a basic need to survive, nourishes our body with necessary nutrients for growth. In the modern day, food has become much more - food has expanded beyond serving our basic needs. We now hold business discussions over food, social gatherings over food, celebrations over food, etc. Food has become so widely available with such variety that we may never finish tasting them all.
This website is all about sharing experiences with different types of foods, including the environment in which they are consumed (Restaurants) so that users may either share or find out more about what they would like to eat. Users can read the reviews written by other users and decide for themselves if they want to try, or they can write a review themselves to share their dining experience with others. This website aims to be a platform for which people can exchange views about how their favourite foods taste. Although different tastes appeal to different people, there is no better way to have a better understanding about the desired food than to hear from those who have tasted them.
